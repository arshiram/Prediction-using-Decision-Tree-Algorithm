# Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm
Create the Decision Tree classiﬁer and visualize it graphically.
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classiﬁer, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

This Project is thorugh application of machine learning with python programming. It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools. Here some of algorithm are used that are some types of machine learning subparts algorithms of supervised and Unsupervised learning. Algorithm used for predicting and get accuracy is Dicision tree classifier.
You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS)
